Hi, I'm **Arnold Daniels**.

I've been a software developer since 2001, starting in open-source web development and diving into blockchain in 2017. I co-founded [LTO Network](https://github.com/ltonetwork), a blockchain company focused on practical, real-world applications of decentralized technology.

I’m not the corporate type - you won’t find me in a Fortune 500 company. I prefer the startup world, where you can build things from the ground up and make a real impact. Over the years, I’ve helped many entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into something tangible.

Please take a look at my open-source repositories here on GitHub. It's a large collection of things I've built over the last two decades.
